# BookTracker
## Created by Clarence Ortega
An app that allows users to keep track of books that they have read or plan to read.\
Users can sort their lists and view statistics as well!
### How to Use
After downloading and launching the app, you will be greeted with the registration page.\
You can make an account here, but you can't use the same email as someone else.\
Once you log in, you have access to your book list, statistics, and adding in books.\
Any books you add will be saved into the database with your account, so even if you log out,\
your info will still be there in your account.
### Current Issues
- There is a bug when sorting by "Pages." The app seems to only sort by the first number,\
and this is probably because the pages were not saved as integers.
- There may be some issues if the user enters in too many words, and this could\
mess up the look of the app.
